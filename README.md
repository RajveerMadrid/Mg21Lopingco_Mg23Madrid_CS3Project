### Description:

Do you enjoy fidgeting with your mouse and clicking randomly on your screen? If so, this website will be an
enjoyable experience for you! Click Civilization is a website with fun, random, silly minigames and applications all
involving the extremely fun entertaning activity of clicking. This website will include a CPS (clicks per second) test, a reaction
time test, a mini idle clicking game (similar to games like cookie clicker), and other added minigames.

### Use of JavaScript:

JavaScript will be heavily used for the mini applications and minigames. An example of this would be for the 
reaction time test. In this mini application, we would need to use JavaScript in order to detect the click of the 
user then check how much time it took for them to click on the window. We would also need to randomize the time
it takes for the cue to click (The change of color) to display using the random function so as to not make the change predictable as 
it would defeat the entire purpose of the test.
